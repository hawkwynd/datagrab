Datagrab Excercise
===================

A sample php script using cURL to import XML feed, store the file for ExpressionEngine datagrab imports.
Additionally, a sample use of storing sensitive informaiton outside the document root directory in a .ini file
to provide additional security from 'prying' eyes.

ExpressionEngine Datagrab module imports the jobs_processed_2.xml file, updating entries in the set channel,
removing entries which are not included in the feed.
